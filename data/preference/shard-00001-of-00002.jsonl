{"input_text": "I am asking this on behalf of a close friend of mine who is a 22 year old female. She is one of the sweetest most innocent people I know, but recently I learned that she suffers from some pretty severe self condemnation issues. She can trace this back to journal entry when she was just 10 years old, and when she was in her teens she would cut herself after doing something wrong by her parents (mostly her super strict dad), because she felt it was \"necessary\". \nRecently she revealed that, essentially as a safer alternative to cutting she (I know this sounds odd) but she would masturbate. Evidently, this works for her because she was always taught growing up that masturbating is like, super wrong (sexual immorality by view of overly strict religious father), but of course she did it on occasion anyway for the same reasons we all do. So, instead of cutting herself, she taught herself to go do that, and then, (they way she described it), she would use the guilt of being \"sexually immoral\" that came afterwards as her means of self punishment and dwell on her idea that she was terrible for doing this until she felt the \"punishment\" was sufficient; as an alternative to cutting. \nEvidently this has gotten to the point of what i think is called a learned reaction in the psychology world. She said that there's been a few times where she will go to masturbate, simply as a stress relief, (after seeing the idea online) or to help her sleep (basically any reason besides self punishment), but instead of the intended reaction, she will automatically start crying and feeling like crap as was intended all those other times. \nRecently she, for the first time, got close with a guy (her first boyfriend), and while she stopped before she completely orgasmed or anything, she evidently got the same reaction, cried got super upset and felt terrible. So evidently, it is not something she can control any longer. \nAny more details needed, and I will post whatever I can, I can't bear to think of how this will effect her and her future relationships, and she is such a nice person.

But no one mentions you can figuratively cram more money into a Roth account.  Let me explain:\n\nYou have an excess of income and will be maxing your 401(k).  If you max out your Roth, you have to pay taxes on all that money, and actually end up with less money now than if you maxed your Traditional.  So basically, in your Traditional account you have the maxed amount minus future taxes.  But in your Roth, you have a full max 401(k).  That's not a fair comparison.  Lets say in the traditional case we take any money not spent on taxes up front and put it in an investment account getting the same rate of return as the 401(k).  Assuming the tax bracket stays the same, upon withdrawal, the Roth account holder will end up with more money since he didn't have to pay a second round of taxes on that non tax advantaged investment account.

We live together, and have done so for ten months. We have been together for almost a year. My mother knows all of this.\n\nShe said that if we couldn't respect her wishes, then we shouldn't come. She is enforcing these religious and regressive rules on us, despite the fact that she permits my brother and his girlfriend to sleep together in the same bed. My brother was permitted to do this when he was nineteen. Furthermore, a few months ago she had even told me that if my boyfriend were to visit, he could sleep in my bed. She said it was fine with her. \n\nMy father is atheist, btw. Also grew up in Scotland, so one would not think him to be so puritanical. My mother and I already have a strained relationship, one that was beginning to get better. However, now it would seem that nothing has actually changed with her. My only fear is that she is going to convince my father to turn against us. \n\nI apologise for the rant. But I am pretty irritated. I have cancelled my boyfriend's reservation to avoid the loss of any money (it has not been paid for). And if my father were to change my mother's mind, I do not think we would go anyway. \n\nWhat do you think reddit?

I'm a 5'9 male that started at 275 lbs and was cutting and counting calories, losing weight at a solid pace. I have switched up my calorie intake a few times throughout, giving myself a lot of calories in the beginning to start slow but eventually was cutting very hard. I was eating around 1200-1300 calories a day and exercising a few times a week. That went on for a couple months but I realized that while I was losing the weight I wasn't feeling that great and that maybe I was doing more harm than good and decided I needed to eat more.  I have been sitting at around 1500 calories a day for the past couple months with exercise around 4 times a week (mostly cardio) and its been solid. I am down to around 187 lbs and am in some of the best shape I have been in years. Also a lot of people have been giving me compliments and its been nice. That being said, I still want to lose another 15 or so pounds but have started to notice my stomach is really flabby and squishy and have noticeable stretch marks. I have started to weight lift heavy and want to get my last weight lost but also look better aesthetically and not just on the scale. was wondering if I should maybe slow my weight loss to a pound a week so I can keep some of the muscle I have and possibly help out with the skin on my stomach.

I am also very concerned that he wants something from us: Money, kidney, forgiveness, etc. \n\nHow can I express to my wife that we need to talk about this before he gets here this afternoon?

Also he was a very masculine man, and the ring and watch were meant for me to wear when I get older.

Netflix takes a very long time to buffer, so we try to start back up again. For some reason, this time I can't get hard. There's very little awkwardness, though. I just chalk it up to being tired.
