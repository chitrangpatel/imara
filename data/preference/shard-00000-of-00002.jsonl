{"input_text": "I've been feeling very hopeless lately, and I'm not sure where to turn for advice. I went to college right out of high school, floated along for almost five years, changing majors twice (Sculpture, to English Lit, to General Studies).

Currently, I work 40 hours a week at a job I enjoy, but it pays me barely enough to live and there's not really upward mobility within the company.

My question for you wonderful people is multi-faceted because I'm floundering and also open to suggestions.\nShould I go back to school? I went to a state school, and I'm sure at least two years of my credits will transfer into another program. Can I finish my degree at a local community college?

If not, how do I get a better job to pay back my student loans?\nWhat program should I pursue that will actually get me somewhere in the future?

She didn't even ask how I was doing after surgery, I had to call her.

In high school, I had to cut back and now only play golf and baseball. I'm not playing either in college (although I will more than likely continue to golf throughout life).

Since then, I've been bogged down with work and snow in the Northeast, so I haven't had much chance at all to run. It's actually been pretty depressing, as I felt like I was making good progress. I had cut down about 15 pounds, which is a definite positive for me.

What should I expect? Does anybody have any recommendations? I want to perform at a high level for my team, but this is it for baseball for me.

{"input_text": "Hey everyone, I am a 21 year old loser (by society's standards) and I'm starting to believe it too.\n\nOkay so here is the problem that is my life. My license is currently suspended because at the time of the suspension i did not have enough money to pay for car insurance and also being a dumb young kid out on my own. My previous insurance carrier notified the dmv my plan expired. After my license was suspended i drove my car on a suspended license and uninsured to a job. I eventually made enough money to pay for a six month insurance premium (2,200$) (esurance) the dmv told me i had to get an sr-22 which basically is a document from the insurance company that states i did pay for a six month premium that is needed in order to reinstate license needed by the dmv. \n\nDuring those happy six months of driving insured i lost my job (restaurant) and now i was left with less than 2,200$ that was needed to buy another 6 month premium. I also needed 250$ on top of that as a reinstatement fee. As of now i just recently my broken car (engine) for 4,000$ and i have 1,000$ in my account from my tax return. So i have 5,000$ no car and a suspended license. If i were to use the money i have to spend on reinstatement it would leave me with 2,200$. Assuming esurance will still let me hold a policy.\n\n I would like to buy another car for at least 4-5,000$ so i don't have to spend all my money on repairs and maintenance.

His legs fall out from underneath him, and before he could protect himself with his arms (he was using them to push people away), he lands face first on the concrete.
